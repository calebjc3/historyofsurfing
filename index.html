<h1>"A history of surfing"</h1>
<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Surfing, or he'e 'ana, is a central part of Polynesian culture and dates back before contact with Europeans. In Hawai'i, surfing held a lot of social weight, as the Cheifs (Ali'i) were often the most skilled and had the best boards. According to Wikipedia: "Surfing is a surface water pastime in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face, of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools." It's very interesting that people have found surfer to be so enjoyable that they now surf in artificial waves or even rivers!</p>

<p>In Tahiti and Samoa, surfing was a popular sport and was also used as a form of exercise to train young warriors. It has since spread all over the world and is one of the most popular ocean sports today. However, Hawai'i remains the undisputed home of surfing, and is famous for its waves and surf competitions. The reach of surf culture has spread far and wide: "Surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing."</p>
